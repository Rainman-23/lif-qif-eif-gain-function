# lif-qif-eif-gain-function

This script uses Brian2 to simulate and plot the gain curve (fâ€“I curve) of LIF, QIF, and EIF neuron models across a range of stimulation current values. The electrophysiological parameters were selected to reflect values commonly reported in the literature.

Any feedback is greatly appreciated. Feel free to propose changes or get in touch.
